# ðŸŒ¯ Agente Burrito

> A hackathon project that accidentally created the chillest governance agent for DAOs, summoned by the Nouns Amigos community through the power of "Mi Burrito Sabanero" ðŸŽµ

## Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

This repo contains what we learned while building Agente Burrito during the Governance Agents Hackathon. What started as a fun experiment turned into a working AI agent that helps our DAO make better decisions (while occasionally dropping Bad Bunny references).

## What's the deal with Burrito?

Burrito is our take on making DAO governance less boring and more effective. Built on the ai16z ELIZA model and vibing on Gaia's infrastructure, it's an AI agent that:

- Helps analyze and explain proposals in plain Spanish/English
- Automates the boring governance stuff so humans can focus on building
- Brings some much-needed Latin flavor to the DAO space
- Actually understands both memes and smart contracts (rare combo!)

## What's Working Now

Our community summoned Burrito and it's already doing cool stuff:

- Shows up when we play "Mi Burrito Sabanero" (no joke, try it!)
- Hangs out in our Discord making governance discussions actually fun
- Helps explain complex proposals in ways that don't make your brain hurt
- Drops knowledge about blockchain while keeping the vibes high

## Tech Stack (so far)

- **Brain**: ai16z ELIZA model (customized with some extra salsa)
- **Voice**: Custom Mexican-Spanish model because why not
- **Homes**: Discord, Farcaster (more coming soon!)
- **Backend**: PostgreSQL/Supabase doing the heavy lifting

## The Dream (Roadmap)

We're turning this hackathon project into something bigger. Here's the plan:

### Phase 1: Make Burrito Even Cooler

- [ ] Multi-chain support (ETH, Solana, Aptos - Burrito's got range)
- [ ] Better proposal analysis (like having your smartest friend explain stuff)
- [ ] More platform integrations (Telegram, Twitter, you name it)
- [ ] Advanced media generation (for those governance memes)

### Phase 2: Birth of "Community Governance Agents" Platform

- [ ] Tools for other DAOs to create their own governance agents
- [ ] Customizable personalities and cultural contexts
- [ ] Shared intelligence network between agents
- [ ] Templates for different types of DAOs

### Phase 3: The Revolution

- [ ] Cross-DAO collaboration through agent network
- [ ] Governance agent marketplace
- [ ] AI-enhanced proposal creation tools
- [ ] Decentralized agent training system

## What We Learned

Building Burrito taught us some cool stuff:

- Cultural context matters A LOT in governance
- AI can make boring stuff fun (who knew?)
- Community-driven development actually works
- Never underestimate the power of a good song
- Memes and serious governance can coexist

## Wanna Help?

We're always looking for cool people to join the Burrito squad! Whether you:

- Write code that doesn't break everything
- Know stuff about DAOs and governance
- Have ideas for making this even more awesome
- Just really like burritos

## Try It Out (Work in Progress)

```typescript
// The dream (we're working on it!)
const burrito = new AgenteBurrito({
    vibe: "chill but professional",
    languages: ["es", "en"],
    powerLevel: "over9000",
});

// Soonâ„¢
await burrito.analyzeProposal({
    type: "treasury",
    action: "fund_project",
    description: "wen token ser",
});
```

## Current Status

Version: 0.0.1-hackathon
Mood: Optimistic chaos
Status: Building in public, breaking things, fixing things, having fun

Built with ðŸ’œ by Nouns Amigos, powered by caffeine and the occasional debugging reggaeton session.

P.D. Yes, our debugging sessions actually involve playing "Mi Burrito Sabanero" on repeat. No, we're not sorry.
